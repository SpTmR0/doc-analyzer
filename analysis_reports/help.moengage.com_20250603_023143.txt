Launch region-specific sales discounts and offers
Banking and Finance
Show personalized home loan offers, content, and other recommended offers such as loans and product recommendations.
Create tailor-made omnichannel campaigns based on traffic sources and pages viewed. For example, when a visitor clicks on a Facebook ad about credit card offers, you can show them the same offer on your website and send them a personalized email to nudge them to purchase.
Returning visitors can be shown promotional offers on the home page designed specifically for them. For instance, if a visitor fills out a loan calculator on a bank’s website but does not apply for a loan, you can show a personalized banner based on variables entered in the calculator to nudge them to apply for the loan.
